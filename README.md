This project consists of two notebooks:
* 0_preprocessing.ipynb – preprocesses the original bike_data.csv file and saves the cleaned dataset as l_escooter_trips.parquet
* 1_analysis.ipynb – performs the main temporal and spatial analysis based on the processed data

**Note:** The data folder has been deleted. Both notebooks contain file paths referring to datasets previously located in the data directory (original and processed files).
